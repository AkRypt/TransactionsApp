might be wondering if you paid your debts or not. This is an app for you to keep track of all
your transactions!

- Entry Fragment:
  Here, you can enter the amount, name of the person, description, date and time and press 
  the 'Received' button or 'Paid' button depending on the case.
- Transactions Fragment:
  Here, you will find all your transactions.
- Info Fragment:
  Info about the app and a 'Sign Out' button and 'Clear All Transactions' button which clears all your transactions from the
